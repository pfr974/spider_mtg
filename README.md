My attempt at scrapping Legacy decklists from mtgtop8.com, and also understanding how to use Scrapy, an application framework for crawling web sites. The overall goal of this project is to compile a large dataset of Legacy decklists for personal analysis. Legacy is a Magic the Gathering format. This readme.md and the different files of this folder will be edited as I make progress, so stay tuned for more updates!
